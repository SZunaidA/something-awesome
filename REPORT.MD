# Hacking Minecraft

Note: I am tracking my effective, active time spent on this project on Toggl. This time includes researching, implementation and writing the report. Details on the time spent is at the end of the report. Â 

To hack Minecraft, we basically have to make a "hacked client" which is supposed to include hacks and cheats as modules, unlike the official Mojang client. One popular hacked client is [Future](https://www.futureclient.net/).
